      <p class="animate-slide-up">
        I'm a full-stack developer passionate about creating software that makes a difference. 
        My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and a 
        commitment to continuous learning.
      </p>

      <p class="animate-slide-up animate-delay-100">
        I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that scale. 
        Whether it's architecting backend services with .NET, crafting intuitive user 
        interfaces with React, or deploying cloud solutions on Azure, I approach each 
        project with thoughtfulness and precision.
      </p>

      <p class="animate-slide-up animate-delay-200">
        Beyond the code, I value collaboration, empathy, and building products that serve 
        real needs. I'm guided by principles of integrity, humility, and a desire to leave 
        things better than I found them.
      </p>
